# Computer Architecture Application

## Synopsis
An application I wrote for Android that simulates CPU scheduling and Memory Allocation on processes.

This is my project for a subject in Temasek Polytechnic, CAOS (Computer Architecture and Operating Systems) and it received a Distinction grade.

## Project Details

### Built With 
Android Studio 3.0

### Algorithms
The below algorithms have been written and implemented in the project for simulation : 

#### CPU Scheduling

  - First-Come-First-Serve
  - Shortest Job First (Non-Preemptive)
  - Priority (Non-Preemptive)
  - Round Robin
  
#### Main Memory Allocation
  - First-Fit
  - Best-Fit
  - Worst-Fit

### External Libraries
* [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) - Animated Chart Display for  Memory Allocation
* [Shimmer](https://github.com/RomainPiel/Shimmer-android) - Shimmering Text View in CPU Scheduling


## Todos
**Please feel free to contribute to this project.**
 - Add in Priority (Preemptive) and Shortest Job First (Preemptive) to CPU scheduling algorithms
 - Fix UI to be dynamic (currently constrained to a 5.0 inch display)
